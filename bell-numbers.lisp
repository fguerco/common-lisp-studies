Bell Numbers
https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Bell_numbers

Write a routine (function, generator, whatever) to generate the Bell number
sequence and call the routine to show here, on this page at least the first
15 and (if your language supports big Integers) 50th elements of the sequence.

If you do use the Bell triangle method to generate the numbers, also show the
first ten rows of the Bell triangle.
